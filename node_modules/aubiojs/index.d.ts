/**
 * default : use the default method
 *
 * Currently, the default method is set to yinfft .
 *
 * schmitt : Schmitt trigger
 *
 * This pitch extraction method implements a Schmitt trigger to estimate the
 * period of a signal.
 *
 * This file was derived from the tuneit project, written by Mario Lang to
 * detect the fundamental frequency of a sound.
 *
 * See http://delysid.org/tuneit.html
 *
 * fcomb : a fast harmonic comb filter
 *
 * This pitch extraction method implements a fast harmonic comb filter to
 * determine the fundamental frequency of a harmonic sound.
 *
 * This file was derived from the tuneit project, written by Mario Lang to
 * detect the fundamental frequency of a sound.
 *
 * See http://delysid.org/tuneit.html
 *
 * mcomb : multiple-comb filter
 *
 * This fundamental frequency estimation algorithm implements spectral
 * flattening, multi-comb filtering and peak histogramming.
 *
 * This method was designed by Juan P. Bello and described in:
 *
 * Juan-Pablo Bello. ``Towards the Automated Analysis of Simple Polyphonic
 * Music''.  PhD thesis, Centre for Digital Music, Queen Mary University of
 * London, London, UK, 2003.
 *
 * yin : YIN algorithm
 *
 * This algorithm was developed by A. de Cheveigne and H. Kawahara and
 * published in:
 *
 * De Cheveign√©, A., Kawahara, H. (2002) "YIN, a fundamental frequency
 * estimator for speech and music", J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 111, 1917-1930.
 *
 * see http://recherche.ircam.fr/equipes/pcm/pub/people/cheveign.html
 *
 * yinfast : Yinfast algorithm
 *
 * This algorithm is equivalent to the YIN algorithm, but computed in the
 * spectral domain for efficiency. See also `python/demos/demo_yin_compare.py`.
 *
 * yinfft : Yinfft algorithm
 *
 * This algorithm was derived from the YIN algorithm. In this implementation, a
 * Fourier transform is used to compute a tapered square difference function,
 * which allows spectral weighting. Because the difference function is tapered,
 * the selection of the period is simplified.
